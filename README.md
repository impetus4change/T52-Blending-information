# T5.2 Blending information

In I4C WP5, a number of blending methods have been developed to provide homogeneous predictive information from seasonal to decadal time-scales.
This repository provides the simulation data sets that are selected by applying the developed blending methods to various existing ensembles of global hindcast, prediction and projections across timescales.
