These text files contain list of ranked members from best (at top) and worst (bottom) members for each start-date (i.e. year in the file name).

For example: 
The file 1971_pyrs20DJF_NAO_ObsTHoldPnt3_ERA5pslERA5tas_PatCor_NM250.txt; contains ranked members based on 
winter NAO-tas teleconnection during the previous 20 years (i.e.1951-1970).

Similarly, the file 1972_pyrs20DJF_NAO_ObsTHoldPnt3_ERA5pslERA5tas_PatCor_NM250.txt; contains ranked members based on 
winter NAO-tas teleconnection during the previous 20 years (i.e.1952-1971).
and so on ...

So, the year in file names is the first forecast year after the constraining period.

250 in file names indicate total number of members used.
Files also contain pattern correlation values based on which the members were ranked.
